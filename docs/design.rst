Designing Confirmation2019 Website
==================================

I'm going to take a more gradual approach this year and hopefully I will be able to get something done before the end of
the year!

I have been working on the website, its header, footer, login and logout pages, with the idea of learning Bootstrap 4.
It's looking fairly good and is much more responsive than what I had last year, but I don't want to start with such a
complex site as I was working on then. To start I will try to create a survey based on Matthew Kelly's "The Biggest Lie
in the History of Christianity."

When users log in to the website they will arrive at a Welcome page which explains the purpose of the survey and that
their identity will not be saved with their entries and are strictly confidential. There will be a button on the page
to allow them to enter the survey. They will enter answers one question at a time. I will suggest they don't overthink
their answers with the idea that their first impression is likely to be more appropriate. Once an answer is submitted it
cannot be changed since their identities are not being saved. If any users have to quit before completing the entire
survey they can return to it later at the question where they left off.

I'm thinking there should be a manager app and a separate app for every type of question: true/false, multiple choice,
discussion, etc. This is different than what I did last year, and I haven't thought it through yet, but I'm hoping it
will make for a simpler design.

The manager app will be something like the activity app last year in that it is the launching point for each of the
activities. The difference will be that each of the apps for the individual question types will handle its own work and
the manager app will only have to keep track of which units/questions go into each activity.
